# 19697W-VEX-Code

This repository contains our autonomous code. Through this we are able to maintain our versions properly by pushing and pulling code.
In addition, thorugh GitHub we are able to collaborate on the code on different devices. For example, we have two coders on our robotics team. As a result, commiting, pusshing, and merging are quite easy. Finally, in the case that our code gets corrupted or has an error, we can always revert to older versions for validity of code.
